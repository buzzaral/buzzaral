Hi I'm Andy Buzzard (username: buzzaral)
I'm currently a Senior Financial Analyst for the Boeing Company looking for a career change to software Development. My goal is to transition to Jr. Software Developer by the beginning of 2022. 

In order to do this I'm starting with the following resources:
1) HTML & CSS By John Duckett
2) Javascript & JQuery By John Ducket
3) The Odin Project
4) Codecademy
5) CSS Battle to work on mastering various CSS functions


Open to any suggestions where to go from there. I can be contacted at buzzaral@gmail.com
